                    Today’s and emerging applications are extremely demanding in terms of storage and computing power. Data-intensive/big-data applications and internet-of-things (IoT) will transform the future; they will
                    not only impact the all aspects of our life, but also change a lot in the IC and computer world. Emerging applications require computing power which was typical of supercomputers a few years ago, but with
                    constraints on size, power consumption and guaranteed response time which are typical of the embedded applications. Both today’s computer architectures and device technologies (used to manufacture them) are
                    facing major challenges making them incapable to deliver the required functionalities and features. All of these have led to the slowdown of the traditional device scaling. In order for computing systems to
                    continue deliver sustainable benefits for the foreseeable future society, alternative computing architectures and notions have to be explored in the light of emerging new device technologies. Resistive computing,
                    quantum computing, molecular computing, and neuromorphic computing are couple of alternative computing notions, while memristor devices, quantum dots, spin-wave devices are couple of emerging device technologies.
                    Memristive device is a promising candidate to complement and/or replace traditional CMOS (at least in some applications) due to many advantages including CMOS process compatibility, zero standby power, great scalability
                    and high density, and its potential to implement high density memories and different logic design styles, enabling new computing paradigms.
                    <br/>
                    In this course will prove a global picture on the use of memristive devices for computing. First, the challenges that today’s architecture and technology are facing will be discussed; this will motivate not only the need of
                    new architectures, but also the need of new technologies enabling the implementation of such architecture in efficient manner. Second, the basic fundamentals of meristive devices and their potential for memory, logic and arithmetic
                    designs will be explored. Third, memristive devices for computing will be covered; we will discuss both their potential of enabling new computing paradigms (computation-in-memory) and efficient implementations of some existing architectures such as Automata processor.
                    Finally, the challenges will be highlighted.

                </h4>
                <p class="os-text" style="text-align:justify;">
                    Said Hamdioui is currently Chair Professor on Dependable and Emerging Computer Technologies and Head of the Computer Engineering Laboratory (CE-Lab) of the Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands. He received the MSEE and
                    PhD degrees (both with honors) from TUDelft. Prior to joining TUDelft as a professor, Hamdioui spent about seven years within industry including Microprocessor Products Group at Intel Corporation (Califorina, USA), IP and Yield Group
                    at Philips Semiconductors R&D (Crolles, France) and DSP design group at Philips/ NXP Semiconductors (Nijmegen, The Netherlands). His research focuses on two domains: Dependable CMOS nanocomputing (including Reliability, Testability, Hardware Security)
                    and emerging technologies and computing paradigms (including 3D stacked ICs, memristors for logic and storage, in- memorycomputing for big-data applications).
                    <br/>
                    Hamdioui owns two patents, has published one book and contributed to other two, and had coauthored over 180 conference and journal papers. He has consulted for many companies (such as Intel, ST, Altera, Atmel, Renesas, ...) in the area of memory testing
                    and has collaborated with many industry/research partners (examples are Intel, IMEC, NXP , Intrinsic ID, DS2, ST Microelectronics, Cadence, Politic di Torino, etc) in the field of dependable nano-computimng and emerging technologies. He is strongly involved
                    in the international community as a member of organizing 2 committees (e.g., general chair, program chair, etc) or a member of the technical program committees of the leading conferences. He delivered dozens of keynote speeches, distinguished lectures, and
                    invited presentations and tutorial at major international forums/conferences/schools and at leading semiconductor companies. Hamdioui is a Senior member of the IEEE, Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems (TVLSI), and he serves on the editorial
                    board of IEEE Design & Test, Elsevier Microelectronic Reliability Journal, and of the Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and Applications (JETTA). He is also member of AENEAS/ENIAC Scientific Committee Council (AENEAS =Association for European NanoElectronics Activities).
                    <br/>
                    Hamdioui is the recipient of many international/national awards. E.g., he is the the recipient of European Design Automation Association Outstanding Dissertation Award 2001; Best Paper Award at the International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology FCST- 2017;
                    Teacher of the Year Award at the faculty of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands; Best paper Award at IEEE Latin American Teat Symposium 2018; Best Paper Award at IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (IVLSI) 2016; the 2015 HiPEAC Technology Transfer Award,
                    Best Paper Award at 33rd IEEE International Conference on Computer Design ICCD 2015, Best paper Award at International conference on Design and Test of Integrated Systems in the nano-era DTIS 2011, IEEE Nano and Nano Korea award at IEEE NANO 2010, Intel informal Award for developed test methods for
                    embedded caches in Itanuim processors. In addition, he is a leading member of Cadence Academic Network on Dependability and Design-for-Testability, and he was nominated for The Young Academy of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) in 2009. Hamdoui is also the initiator and the coordinator
                    of an EU project on computation-in-memory architecture based on resistive devices.
